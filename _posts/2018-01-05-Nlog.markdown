## Nlog


- 下载Nlog.dll
- 下载配置文件，配置配置文件，设置为**Copy Always**

    在 `<targets>` 添加`<targetname="logfile"xsi:type="File"fileName="file.txt" />`

    在`<rule>`里设置`<loggername="*"minlevel="Info"writeTo="logfile" />`

    代码里使用`private Logger logger = LoggerManager.GetCurrentClassLogger();`
***
`Trace` - very detailed logs, which may include high-volume information such as protocol payloads. This log level is typica lly only enabled during development

`Debug` - debugging information, less detailed than trace, typically not enabled in production environment.

`Info` - information messages, which are normally enabled in production environment

`Warn` - warning messages, typically for non-critical issues, which can be recovered or which are temporary failures

`Error` - error messages - most of the time these are Exceptions

`Fatal` - very serious errors!
