##### Sensor
###### Gravity Sensor
The gravity sensor provides a three dimensional vector indicating the direction and magnitude of gravity
```Kotlin
val sensorManager = applicationContext.getSystemService(Context.SENSOR_SERVICE) as SensorManager
val sensor = sensorManager.getDefaultSensor(Sensor.TYPE_GRAVITY)
```

###### Linear Accelerometer
The linear acceleration sensor provides you with a three-dimensional vector representing acceleration along each device axis, excluding gravity. You can use this value to perform gesture detection.
```Kotlin
val sensorManager = applicationContext.getSystemService(Context.SENSOR_SERVICE) as SensorManager
val sensor = sensorManager.getDefaultSensor(Sensor.TYPE_LINEAR_ACCELERATION)
```

###### Rotation Vector Sensor
The rotation vector represents the orientation of the device as a combination of an angle and an axis, in which the device has rotated through an angle Î¸ around an axis (x, y, or z). The following code shows you how to get an instance of the default rotation vector sensor:
```Kotlin
val sensorManager = applicationContext.getSystemService(Context.SENSOR_SERVICE) as SensorManager
val sensor = sensorManager.getDefaultSensor(Sensor.TYPE_ROTATION_VECTOR)
```
