`.gitkeep` isn’t documented, because it’s not a feature of `Git`.

`Git` cannot add a completely empty directory. People who want to track empty directories in `Git` have created the convention of putting files called `.gitkeep` in these directories. The file could be called anything; `Git` assigns no special significance to this name.

There is a competing convention of adding a `.gitignore` file to the empty directories to get them tracked, but some people see this as confusing since the goal is to keep the empty directories, not ignore them; `.gitignore` is also used to list files that should be ignored by `Git` when looking for untracked files.
